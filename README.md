# Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments on the 2024 Inauguration of the Indonesian President

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that compares the effectiveness of four machine learning algorithms—Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression—on YouTube comments related to the 2024 Indonesian presidential inauguration. Data scraping and lexicon-based sentiment labeling were employed to collect and preprocess the dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to:
1. Scrape YouTube comments related to the 2024 Indonesian presidential inauguration.
2. Preprocess the data, including sentiment labeling based on a lexicon approach.
3. Train and evaluate four different algorithms to classify sentiments: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
4. Compare the performance metrics of these algorithms to determine the most effective model.

## Dataset

- **Source**: YouTube comments on videos related to the 2024 inauguration of the Indonesian President
- ('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LYmM9TgR8I')
- **Labeling**: Sentiment labeling is done using a lexicon-based approach for Indonesian sentiment classification.
  
## Algorithms Used

1. **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Random Forest (RF)**
4. **Logistic Regression (LogReg)**
